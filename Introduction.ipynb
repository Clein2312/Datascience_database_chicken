    "a database is a collection of structured data that is stored and can be accessed electronically. A database management system (DBMS) is the software that controls the database. There are a lot of types of databases based on the type of their content, which will give specific functionalities. However, for this workshop, we will focus only on relational databases. A relational database is a set of organized **tables** with contain **rows**, **columns** and can store **relationships**. These relationships define how different tables relate to each other.\n",

    "A **row** refers to an observation, or one record. **Columns** contain attribute information, so the different characteristics of the records. A **table** or relation is then a set of records that share the same attributes, or in other words, a set of rows and columns.\n",
