    "1. __Learn how to create a database using SQL__: To create or manipulate the database here is DDL(Data Definition Language) from SQL. It includes most common SQL statements are  CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE. and it is used to create table, modify table structure , drop table structure, and delete data from the table.\n",
    "    - Understand how to define tables, columns, and relationships in a database\n",
    "        - A database is collection of schema\n",
    "        - Schema is a collection of tables\n",
    "        - Tables is collection of columns and rows.Where data is stored in an organised way. Columns can be identify as vertical and rows as horizontal. \n",
    "        - __Relationship in Database__: Database is usually constructs of tabels and the relationship among them. The relationship of tabels can be explain by the entity. __Entity__ could be an real-world object, either tangible or intangible, that can be easily indentifiable. In the Chicken database entities can be Chicken, Group, Breed etc. Each entities has some associated proprties by which we can idetify it.\n",
