    "        - __Relationship in Database__: Database is usually constructs of tabels and the relationship among them. The relationship of tabels can be explain by the entity. __Entity__ could be an real-world object, either tangible or intangible, that can be easily indentifiable. In the Chicken database entities can be Chicken, Group, Breed etc. Each entities has some associated proprties by which we can idetify it.\n",
